<h1>About the Game Design</h1>
<hr>

<h2>1. Goal, Rules, and Core Loop</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Explore a hostile fantasy map to collect crystals and stop the war between nations by surviving enemy zones.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong> Avoid enemies, collect crystals, and reach safe checkpoints; getting hit reduces health.</p>
<p><strong>Core Loop:</strong> Explore → Collect → Avoid/Fight → Upgrade → Explore again.</p>

<h2>2. Simple Feedback</h2>
<p>When a crystal is collected, it emits a bright glow and a short <strong>“chime”</strong> sound.</p>

<h2>3. SCAMPER – Applied to Minecraft</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>S (Substitute):</strong> Replace blocks with living biomes that slowly move and change shape.</li>
    <li><strong>C (Combine):</strong> Combine crafting with magic spells (craft + enchant in one system).</li>
    <li><strong>A (Adapt):</strong> Adapt survival mechanics into a story-driven quest mode.</li>
    <li><strong>M (Modify):</strong> Modify enemies to evolve based on player behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>P (Put to another use):</strong> Use redstone as an energy source for vehicles, not just machines.</li>
    <li><strong>E (Eliminate):</strong> Remove hunger to focus purely on exploration and creativity.</li>
    <li><strong>R (Reverse):</strong> Start with a built world and slowly watch it decay instead of building it up.</li>
</ul>
